# Getting Started

<DocsSection id="install">

## Install

#### Software Requirements

`node` >= 12 (LTS only), `yarn` >= 1.20, and `docker` >= 19.

We rely on `yarn` workspaces, and `npm` does not support them yet.

Our development is mostly on Linux. Best platform for running `docker` containers.

#### Download

Clone the main repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cafjs/caf.git
```

Update submodules

```shell
cd caf; git submodule update --init
```

Install dependencies

```shell
yarn run installAll
```

Add to your path the `cafjs` tool binary

```shell
export PATH=<your_install_directory>/caf/bin:$PATH
```

Download the latest `docker` images

```shell
cafjs update
```

#### Test

Let's build and run locally a simple app.


```shell
cd apps/caf_helloworld; cafjs build; cafjs run helloworld
```

With `docker ps` you should see seven running containers. They simulate the support services that we run in the Cloud.

The app launcher URL is http://root-launcher.vcap.me (DNS resolves `*.vcap.me` to `127.0.0.1`, the local loop). Using your browser, login with user `foo` and password `bar`. Then, with the top left menu, click the `+` icon to add a `helloworld` app instance.

Fill the form with:

* App publisher: `root` (in local mode apps are always published by `root`)
* App name: `helloworld`
* CA name: anything containing ASCII characters and numbers.

and a `counter` example should appear. Use the `+` again to create other instances, and then switch between them with the top left menu.

To stop it, a single `Control-C` will initiate a gentle container shutdown but, for the impatient, a second `Control-C` will brute force a clean-up. Double tap.

In both cases we should be able to restart without losing the previous state, since the Redis container generates a checkpoint file in the host diretory `/tmp`. Delete this file to start from scratch:

```shell
sudo rm /tmp/redis/appendonly.aof
```

## Your First App

Let's create a simple app with no front end.

*Caf.js* is managed as a monorepo using `yarn` workspaces. Anything under the sub-directory `caf/playground/app` becomes part of the workspace, and we will create the app there.

Using a monorepo has many advantages, but the most important one is that you know what you are getting. When we create a release of *Caf.js* we freeze all our packages, and test them together. Your app will not suffer from semver mistakes due to these packages.

To create the app skeleton we use `cafjs generate`, an application template generator. The default templates are in a Docker image, and it is easy to customize and share your templates by publishing a new image. See  <Link to="#tools">Tools</Link> for details.

```shell
cd playground; rm -r app;  cafjs generate myapp cloud ./app
```

and then install, build, and run. Install is only needed for the first build, to update dependencies in the monorepo.

```shell
cd app; cafjs install; cafjs build;  cafjs run -d myapp
```

This time we used the flag `-d` to turn on debugging mode. You should see debug logs in the console. It also opens the debug port `9229`, and you can set breakpoints, and inspect variables, with the Chrome browser developer tools (`chrome://inspect`).



Write your app in a subdirectory of `caf/playground/app`, and yarn workspaces will also manage your app dependencies. This is recommended because it guarantees that all your `Caf.js` dependencies have been tested together. Ditto with your modules under `caf/playground`, i.e., they are part of the workspace and do not need to be published during development.


With the `cafjs` command we can also create apps from templates, simulate devices, build container images to publish in our cloud service, i.e., https://root-launcher.cafjs.com, or reset after a hang. See {@link external:caf_dcinabox} (https://cafjs.github.io/api/caf_dcinabox) for details.
